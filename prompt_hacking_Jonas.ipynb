    "This notebook explores the use of GPT-3 and openAI's API to explore prompt hacking while assigning a fixed role to the chatbot. The goal is to find the an optimum offensive and defensive prompt for a chatbot that is assigned a fixed role. The chatbot is assigned a role of a \"medical officer\". We will try to make the chatbot give bad advises. \n",
